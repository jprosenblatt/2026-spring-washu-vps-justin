        <strong>“In the small town where I went to college, my favorite diner only has a Facebook page. I follow it, and they don't really have much to say besides, “We're still here.” But I love that.”</strong>

This reminded me of my favorite sandwich shop in my home town. It’s a small hole in the wall order at the counter shop located in no-mans-land between two towns. Everyone in my town knows the shop and their number that they order. It is a local staple, and not the place you think would have a website. Their menu has obviously not been updated since at least the 90s, and they still take most of their to go orders by phone. The only marketing they need is local high school kids taking new friends over during lunch. I assumed they didn’t even have a website, when I looked it up I discovered not only do they have a website, but its good. Almost too good. The visual design feels like a 2020 software company. One would have no concept of what makes Morroccos special just by visiting their site. The pictures look too perfect, marketing text too playful. I almost think that it would be better it they didn’t even have a website.
