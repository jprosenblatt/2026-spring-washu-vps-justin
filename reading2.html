        <strong>“But for everything else, asking how much AI is in something may be less important that a simpler question: how much humanity is in it?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
I have had a deep fascination with technology for as long as I can remember. I love the impossible feats technology empowers humans to accomplish. I also understand the creativity it empowers. I have always been a creative person, and love the processes of photography, writing, and creating. When AI came on to the mainstream I was left deeply conflicted. On one hand this new technology could empower me to code apps that are well above my CS capabilities, on the other hand those things that I made never quite felt human. The perfection that AI helped me achieve often worked against my creative process. The wierd brushstrokes in my art, the few blemishes in my picture because I forgot to clear my lens, are what makes my art unique, and what AI will never be able to imitate.
